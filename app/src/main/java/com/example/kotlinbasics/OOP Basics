The five basic concepts are:

- variables and types:
  A variable is a location in memory. To indicate the storage area,each variable should be given a
  unique name (identifier).

- control flows:
  Control flows allow to do something conditionally and to repeatedly run code.

- functions:
  Functions enable us to separate code and to run code blocks when needed.

- collections:
  Collections enable us to store multiple elements in one place and iterate through multiple
  elements (with the help of control flows)

- classes and object (including inheritance):
  Classes allow us to create our own data types, keep the data members and methods together in one
  place and write more readable and maintainable code which helps us  to work better in a team.
